# Question

What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

`.then` is for when you promise is resolved. `.catch` is for when your promise is rejected. They both are call back functions used as consumers of the promise.

# Teacher Feedback

Small correction, they are not both callback functions, they both take in a callback function!
