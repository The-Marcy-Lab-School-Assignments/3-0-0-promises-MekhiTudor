# Question

Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve("Inside promise").then(console.log);
console.log("Outside promise");
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

`console.log('Outside Promise')` will print first because synchronous code ALWAYS prints before asynchronous code.
